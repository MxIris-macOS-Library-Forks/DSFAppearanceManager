/// A readers/writer lock object.
///
/// This lock allows multiple simultaneous readers, but only a single writer.
///
/// Be careful with class type `ValueType`s bleeding outside the access blocks (mostly, its bad)
///
/// **Q: Why not a concurrent DispatchQueue and use `.barrier` for the writes?**
///
/// Calling 'queue.sync {}' on a concurrent DispatchQueue creates a new thread (well, it
/// allocates one from the processes thread pool) in order to perform the locked block.
/// And given that a process has a limited number of threads it can access, if there's a high
/// number of concurrent accesses a queue can deadlock.
///
/// I didn't want to have thread(s) used for each and every rw lock object access, so I fell down to a lower level
/// and used pthread rwlock objects instead.
///
/// Note that for ValueType == class types:
/// This class only restricts access to the _value_. If `ValueType` is a class, once you have access
/// to the value (the class object) you can modify its _members_ as much as you want.
/// The user is responsible for verifying that class type member access is read-only as well.
